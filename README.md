# Unified Seller Panel (Standalone Test Version)

This version of the project is a fully interactive prototype that runs entirely in your web browser. You do **not** need Node.js or a local server to test it. All the dummy data and logic are self-contained.

## Key Features in this Version:

* **Order Details in Pop-up:** Clicking an order now opens a clean, professional modal window, preventing the page layout from shifting.
* **Full Seller Actions:** The pop-up includes a full menu of actions:
    * Mark as Processing/Shipped
    * Download Label (Simulated)
    * Cancel Order (with confirmation)
* **Seller Name Filter:** You can filter the order list by platform (All, Amazon, Shopify, Flipkart).
* **Functional Settings Page:** A new settings page allows you to view the status of your seller connections.
* **Correct Seller Logos:** The platform logos for Amazon, Shopify, and Flipkart now use the correct, high-quality SVG links you provided.
* **Image Fallback:** Broken product images are gracefully replaced with a professional placeholder showing the item's initials.

## How to Run This Project

1.  **Save the Files:** Make sure both `index.html` and `app.js` are saved in the same folder on your computer.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Simply double-click the `index.html` file, or drag it into an open Chrome or Firefox window.
3.  **Test Everything:** The dashboard will load and be fully interactive with all the latest features.



This setup is perfect for testing the complete user interface and flow without worrying about any backend components.
